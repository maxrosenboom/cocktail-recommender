Mm tangy tastey! I really like the taste of lime, but you might wanna tone it down below 25% of the drink if you are less a fan of the tart. Whatever you do, be sure to squeeze fresh limes! Do not use lime juice from a bottle. It's not even close to the same thing.

I think I might crank up the gin a tad next time, but this is very drinkable! Since No. Ten is so expensive I usually reach behind that bottle for plain Tanqueray or Rangpur (makes a great gin and tonic!). This may not be an "appropriate" use for it, but I thought I'd splurge. I gotta say, No. Ten has a little extra something. I may have to splurge a little more often.

Green_Doodoo_recipe is made with vodka, Kahlua®_coffee_liqueur, Midori®_melon_liqueur, peppermint_schnapps, cream This is a simple method to get drunk and high in one shot. Take some high quality cannabis, leaves, hash, and put it in a bottle of at least 100 proof liquor. The higher % alcohol and more pot you use, the more drunk and high you will be. The thc absorbs into the alcoholic beverage. Shake daily and let it sit for a couple of weeks (go at least 2 weeks or more) then collect the leaves and material out of the beverage with a strainer or cheese cloth. after it's done sitting. Pour it into another bottle or w/e under a cheese cloth, just be sure to strain the plant matter out.

Keep in mind that if you use 16 grams in a 16 oz bottle, thats 1 gram for every 16 oz of liquid. If you do 32 grams in a 16 oz bottle, that's 2 grams for every 1 oz. Also, remember that the longer you let it sit and the more you shake it, the more the thc bonds with the alcohol.

After that add around 1/2 a pack of skittles (dependant on how merry you'd like to be, add more for flavour and buzz)

Shake well untill skittles have lost colour and coloured the redbull (hence clear plastic bottle)

Now add the vodka shots one by one. mix by shaking ensure no foam is present from bubbling.

After the vodka has been added, add the rose wine to give more volume and flavour.

Once the wine has been added, add the marshmellows these should float around the surface but try to ensure they absorb enough of the liquid to turn colour. (usually a pink colour)

Chill for 15 minutes in the fridge, make sure is doesnt freeze.

Serve in a big bowl or straight from bottle.

Diabetics should stay away from this drink goes without saying due to the large quantities of sugar. Plus this is pretty hardcore so make sure you drink with someone else who can look after you.

After the nutmegs are smashed up, put them in a blender (or whatever you prefer).

Then put 3 shots of vodka in there to take out the nutmeg's flavor. Any hard liquor does the trick. Blend or shake till all is mixed well.

Add in the ginger ale as much to your liking. Around 2 cups should do the trick, maybe even more.

Add a shot of Malibu to bring a tropical hint. Add a little bit of vanila extract (not important, but is suggested).

Stir and mix well, settle down with ice in an old-fashioned glass. If for some reason the nutmeg is still chunky, just consume it. It's fine.

(The term "Mexican chocolate" is vague, but Boyd's Chocolate Mexicano is what I use. Basically, it's spiced chocolate) Add the Bailey's and Schnapps and stir until the chocolate dissolves as much as possible.

If you've mixed your proportions correctly, the chocolate will not fully dissolve, producing a somewhat "cement mix" consistency and a slight viscosity. This is good. Add boiling water until the mug is approximately 3/4 full and stir again until it smooths out. A little bit of froth should form on the top. This is also good. Add more boiling water to top off the mug and stir briefly but quickly to mix.

If you've done everything right, there should be a light froth on the top and a mint-chocolate aroma. Enjoy while hot.

Muddle together, but don't break down the mint too much, otherwise, You'll be sipping mint bits. If you don't have muddler, you can use a wooden spoon, or the bottom of an ice cream scoop handle. You want to basically crush the juice out of the limes, while using the sugar to grind against the limes and mint to release their oils and flavors. You're not trying to dissolve the sugar here.

Next pour in the alcohol. I like grey goose because its particularly light, you can use whatever you have on hand, or use 3 oz of Barcardi Limon in place of the light rum and grey goose.

Some people add the ice here, but I don't recommend it, because if you do, then the sugar is hard to dissolve, and you end up sipping grains of sugar, so rather, stir with a bartender's swizzle stick, or whatever you have on hand, don't shake though, cause it'll damage the mint, breaking it apart.

Once the sugar is dissolved (you can usually tell after about 20 vigorous stirs, or when you look at the bottom of the glass and see no sediment), and lots of ice, and top off with club soda, about 3 oz or just to the top.

Stir to mix in the club soda, and drop in a straw and enjoy!

Notes
* The Corona should be cold (from a refrigerator).
* While not required, the lemon juice should be cold (from a refrigerator) and the Tanqueray should be chilled (in a freezer).
* "More" is not "better" - Using more than a half shot of gin or lemon will ruin the flavor.
* Gins vary widely in flavor. While other gins can be used, the original gin used by the creator is Tanqueray.
* Don't use lime as a substitute for lemon. Pompous_Mexican_recipe is made with Corona®_lager, Tanqueray®_gin, lemon_juice Lightly beat all ingredients except bitters.

Use the largest 'elegant' glass possible for a good sized drink, pour the Vodka first, as you only need a little, and won't be able to tell if you add the Advocaat first; between 10-30 mls of Vodka only, too much will over bare on the delicate Advocaat flavours! Then add the Advocaat, around a fifth to a quarter of the whole glass, squeeze a very little lime in for zing, and fill half way with ICE cold lemonade (NEVER diet) Sprite or 7Up are good, as they have citrus hints (tip - use cans not bottles of lemonade, this means you always get maximum fizz), stir gently, then top up all the way (don't fill all the way on the first pour of lemonade as it will fly over the top).

Next, muddle the mint leaves, key lime wedges, and simple syrup (1 oz.)in a glass. What you are trying to do is get the oils from the limes and the flavor of the mint leaves to mix with the simple syrup.

Then add your 1 1/2 oz. of Light Rum, preferably Bacardi Superior. Follow that by adding ice to your glass (cracked ice if you have it). At this point shake or stir the mixture.

The Vodka Dragon is prepared by adding the three vodkas one after the other into the glass, and drinking the mixture without stirring or shaking.

Each vodka should be cold before pouring, and absolutely no ice should ever be added. Drinkig any vodka on the rocks is abyssmal and ruins the spirit.

The three vodkas used should consist of one with a strong burn to give the dragon its breath, which goes on the bottom (Finlandia). One that is heavy on the flavour and a little on the bitter side for the dragons tough hide, to go in the middle (Dwerok). And one that is sweet and smooth with subtle rich flavours to go on the top, for the dragons magic (Stolichnaya).

Note: I prefer to add segments of citrus when they are cut into what are called supremes (pronounced soo-prems). To do this, take a knife and cut the rind of whatever citrus fruit you are using going from top to bottom in strips. Once the fruit is peeled, cut segments from the citrus in between the white membranes that separate the segments. That's it. Very easy and the juice from a segment cut like this can add more depth of flavor to a drink.

Fill glass with ice and pour Zima and the contents of the shaker glass at the time so it is a one-to-one ratio. Stir and serve. Makes about four drinks.(depending on the ice)

Tastes like an Electric Lemonade with Zima instead of lemon-lime soda and more sour mix. Instead of triple sec, you can also use blue curacao. It makes it a pretty blue-green drink.

Also, keep a LOT of extra ice on hand because this drink has so much alcohol it melts the ice immediately, which is why you should not put ice in the shaker, it will dilute the drink.
